Caesar Cipher (a.k.a Shift Cipher)

## Summary
A Caesar Cipher (or more simply known as a shift cipher) is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It works by shifting the alphabet a number of spaces (known as your key) along the alphabet. Therefore, the letter e encrypted using this cipher with a left shift of 3 (-3) would become a b. You can see more examples below:

### Example:

`x	y	z	a	b	c	d	e	f	...`
